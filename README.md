# Weather Prediction and Visualization

## Overview
This project demonstrates weather prediction and visualization using Python. It collects real-time weather data for **Bangalore** (Bengaluru) from the OpenWeatherMap API, trains a **Random Forest Regressor** model, and visualizes temperature trends.

## Features
- **Data Collection**:
  - Fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
  - Retrieves information such as coordinates, weather conditions, temperature, and humidity.

- **Data Processing and Prediction**:
  - Constructs a Random Forest Regressor model.
  - Features include temperature and humidity.
  - Predicts weather based on input feature values (e.g., [27¬∞C, 68% humidity]).

- **Data Storage**:
  - Saves the retrieved weather data as a text file named **"weather_data.txt"**.

- **Visualization**:
  - Creates a line plot using Matplotlib to visualize temperature trends over three days.

## Usage
1. Install the required Python libraries (e.g., `requests`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`).
2. Run the provided Python script to collect weather data, train the model, and visualize trends.
3. Adjust feature values to make weather predictions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `requests`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`

## Acknowledgments
- Data provided by OpenWeatherMap API.
- Inspired by weather forecasting and machine learning.
